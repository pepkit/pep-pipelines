This repository aims to show users how to run `nf-core` pipeline with PEP as input, using [taxprofiler](https://nf-co.re/taxprofiler) pipeline as an example.

The command would look something like that:
```
nextflow run nf-core/taxprofiler -profile test_pep --outdir /home/cgf8xr/nextflow-output
```
